Social engineering is the practice of manipulating people into performing actions or revealing confidential information. Instead of exploiting software vulnerabilities, attackers exploit human tendencies: trust, helpfulness, fear, curiosity, urgency, authority, and routine.

## 1. Phishing (broad)

**What:** Mass emails that trick users into clicking links, opening attachments, or giving credentials.  
**Example:** “Your bank account has been locked — click here to verify.”  
**Scenario:** An employee receives an email from "support@bigbank.com" asking to reset the password. The link points to a fake site that captures credentials.

## 2. Spear Phishing

**What:** Targeted phishing using specific personal or org information to increase credibility.  
**Example:** An email referencing a recent project and naming the employee's manager.  
**Scenario:** Finance gets an email from a vendor (spoofed) with an invoice and a PDF. The PDF contains a macro that runs malware when opened.

## 3. Whaling

**What:** High-value spear phishing aimed at executives/decision-makers.  
**Example:** Fake CEO email requesting wire transfer.  
**Scenario:** CFO gets a supposedly urgent email from CEO: “Wire $200K to account X for acquisition—don’t loop anyone in.” CFO wires funds before verifying.

## 4. Vishing (voice phishing)

**What:** Phone calls impersonating authority (bank, IT, police).  
**Example:** Caller says they’re from IT and need admin credentials to fix an outage.  
**Scenario:** Employee receives a call: “This is IT, we need your VPN password to fix a security issue.” The employee complies.

## 5. Smishing (SMS phishing)

**What:** Text messages that contain malicious links or requests for info.  
**Example:** “Your package failed delivery — click to reschedule.”  
**Scenario:** User clicks SMS link, installs a malicious APK (on Android) that steals credentials.

## 6. Pretexting

**What:** Creating a fabricated scenario to obtain information or perform actions.  
**Example:** Attacker pretends to be an auditor needing payroll data.  
**Scenario:** Attacker calls HR, claims to be from payroll software provider, asks HR to email employee salary spreadsheets.

## 7. Baiting

**What:** Leaving physical media or offering online “free” items that contain malware.  
**Example:** USB sticks labeled “Payroll 2025” left in office parking lot.  
**Scenario:** Curious employee plugs USB into workstation; an autorun exploit installs a backdoor.

## 8. Quid Pro Quo

**What:** Attacker offers a service in exchange for information.  
**Example:** “I’m IT support — I’ll fix your problem if you give me login credentials.”  
**Scenario:** Employee wants quick fix; technician asks for password, gets access.

## 9. Tailgating / Piggybacking

**What:** Physically following an authorized person into secure areas.  
**Example:** Someone asks to hold the door open ("My hands are full").  
**Scenario:** Attacker follows an employee through a secure turnstile and accesses server room.

## 10. Shoulder Surfing

**What:** Observing someone’s screen or keyboard to glean credentials or info.  
**Example:** Watching over a shoulder at a café to capture a password.  
**Scenario:** Attacker records a user entering a PIN at an ATM, later uses it to withdraw funds.

## 11. Watering Hole Attack

**What:** Compromise a website frequented by a target group to infect visitors.  
**Example:** Infecting a professional forum with a drive-by exploit.  
**Scenario:** Engineers visit an industry portal; attacker injects exploit that drops malware.

## 12. Dumpster Diving

**What:** Searching trash for sensitive documents (printed credentials, notes).  
**Example:** Finding discarded employee login lists or invoices.  
**Scenario:** Attacker reconstructs shredded employee records to craft targeted scams.

## 13. Social Media Profiling (Recon)

**What:** Gathering info from social profiles to craft believable attacks.  
**Example:** Using LinkedIn to find job titles, project names, travel schedules.  
**Scenario:** Attacker sees an employee posting travel dates and times emails with fake hotel changes while the employee is away.
